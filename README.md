# Version Information
The latest version of the pack was designed for version `1.20.5`, 
but it was developed during version `1.20.5 Pre-Release 1`.

If updates occur, some elements may not work anymore. 

I will try to update the data pack when new updates come out.

# Description
To put it simply, every entity, block, and recipe can now give you at most 1 item, and all items are unstackable.

This datapack's aim is to give players a challenging, and different experience from vanilla, while being quite familiar.

Other aspects of the game have not been changed, and the game should be fully playable in survival.

## Features
- **ALL** items are now unstackable
- **ALL** recipes (crafting, smelting, etc.) give you 1 item
- **ALL** entities can drop at most 1 of an item when killed, but drops were not made rarer
- **ALL** block give you at most 1 item when broken, but drops were not made rarer
- Fortune and Looting enchantments don't work anymore

## Notes
- All items inside players' inventories or on their cursor will become unstackable and the item's stack count will be limited to 1
- All item entities inside the world will become unstackable and their stack count will be limited to 1

# Installing
The datapack can be installed like any other data pack: drop the pack's `.zip` file **(without unzipping it)** directly inside the `datapacks/` folder of your world, and enable it if needed.

# Known Bugs
- Shearing a Sheep can give you more than 1 item, but items will not be stackable
- "Special" recipes could not be directly changed:
  - Duplicating maps
  - Creating fireworks
  - Tipped arrows
  - etc.
